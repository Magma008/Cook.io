It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period"

        name: "Sashimi",
        data: "The word sashimi means 'pierced body'. This word dates from the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573) and was possibly coined when the word = kiru (cut), the culinary step, was considered too inauspicious to be used by anyone other than samurai. This word may derive from the culinary practice of sticking the fish's tail and fin to the slices for the purpose of identifying the fish being eaten. Another possibility for the name is the traditional method of harvesting. 'Sashimi-grade' fish is caught by individual handline. As soon as the fish is landed, its brain is pierced with a sharp spike, and it is placed in slurried ice."
